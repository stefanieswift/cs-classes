** Core Elements of a program (python)

* idle is the ide

* objects have a type

* two fundamental kinds of type
  - scalar - indivisable  
  - nonscalar

* type (int) and it's literal (3)

* type (float) and it's literal (3.2)

* floats are not real numbers

* type (bool) - True and False

* type (NoneType) and None -> this would be for a temp value

* type (str) and literal ('a')  

* expression is a sequence of operands and operand objects (3+2 would print 5)

* In 3.0 python converts to floats in 2.0 it does not

* Overloaded operators have a meeting the depends on the type of operands

* assignment binds a name to an objects

* straight line program - every command gets executed once in that order - dead boring

* conditional statement - if, else, elif

* programs are wrote to be read

* branching programs - go down and can be separated into different branches

* branching and straight line take the amount of lines not proportional to input

* looping programs - run through input
