# cs-classes

## As a software engineer that did not take the typical path, I am curious to learn the fundamentals that I did not recieve in a formal education

## This is a detailed path of my course work, I took through a variety of mooks. 

I am going to roughly be following [this](http://blog.agupieware.com/2014/06/online-learning-intensive-bachelors.html) syllabus and the advice of others to decide what classes to take. 

Please leave any advice or thoughts below. I will also leave reviews for each of the courses and my thoughts on there worth in my path to acheive more education and mastery in computer science.
